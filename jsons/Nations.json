		"startIntroPart1": "Greetings to you, Keine Kamashirasawa, protector and guardian of the Ningen no Sato. 
							Ningen no Sato is the name for the largest human community within Gensokyo. Commonly referred to as 'the human village' by the other inhabitants of Gensokyo, it remains the safest place for humans in that land.",
		"startIntroPart2": "One of the reasons for that sense of security is that the Ningen no Sato is protected by Keine Kamishirasawa, a were-hakutaku. She possesses the ability to conceal the history -- and thus existence -- of things, and has at times used this ability to safeguard the village from harm. Under the light of a full moon, she transforms into her hakutaku form, which allows her to create, rather than conceal things. She also serves the community as a schoolteacher.
							Knowledgeable and protective Keine, will you guard the people of the Ningen no Sato as they seek to expand and grow? Can you create a civilization that will stand the test of time?",
